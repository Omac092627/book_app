# Book_App

**Author**: Lami Beach
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This week, you and your partner(s) will implement a basic full stack application for a book list which will include the ability to search the Google Books API, add books to a database, and then render those books from a PostgreSQL database. You will also add the ability to update the details of a book or remove it from the collection.

Today's portion of the application involves requesting books from the API. The client can submit a form to search for a book by title or author, and the search results will then be rendered as a list in the browser.

Your entire application will be deployed on Heroku.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.
